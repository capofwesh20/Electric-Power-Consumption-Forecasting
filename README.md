# Electric Power Consumption Forecasting Model for Tetouan

Welcome to our project! Our mission is to build a comprehensive model that predicts electric power consumption in Tetouan, Morocco, with high accuracy. Utilizing historical consumption patterns along with weather-related variables, we aim to craft a predictive tool that enhances the city's energy management strategies.

## Project Objectives

- **Develop a Predictive Model**: Leverage historical electricity usage data and weather conditions to create a robust tool for forecasting power consumption in Tetouan.
- **Optimize Energy Management**: Use our model to improve energy distribution reliability, enabling better planning and utilization of electrical resources.
- **Promote Sustainable Energy Use**: Support Tetouan's transition to more sustainable energy practices by informing policy decisions with accurate data predictions.
- **Address Demand Fluctuations**: Equip the city to effectively manage and anticipate changes in energy demand, especially during periods of extreme weather, ensuring a stable energy supply.

## Impact

By accomplishing our project goals, we will provide Tetouan with the capability to make informed, data-driven decisions regarding energy policy and distribution. This forward-thinking approach will not only contribute to the city's energy efficiency and sustainability but also ensure a reliable power supply for its residents.

## Dataset
The data used in this notebook comes from the Kaggle's Electric Power Consumption dataset. This dataset is a CSV file with 3 columns of electric power consumption recorded at a frequency of 6 samples per hour (1 sample every 10 minutes). Each of these 3 columns represents a zone of the city of Tétouan, in Morocco.

## Features:

Date Time: Time window of ten minutes.
-- Temperature: Weather Temperature.
-- Humidity: Weather Humidity.
-- Wind Speed: Wind Speed.
-- General Diffuse Flows: “Diffuse flow” is a catchall term to describe low-temperature (< 0.2° to ~ 100°C) fluids that slowly discharge through sulfide mounds, fractured       lava flows, and assemblages of bacterial mats and macrofauna.
-- Diffuse Flows

## Target:

Zone 1 Power Consumption
Zone 2 Power Consumption
Zone 3 Power Consumption
